## Overview

- Enemy players can hear when grenade pins are pulled
- Cookable grenades have a cook time of 5 seconds, negating fuse time

## Stun Grenade

<Throwable throwableName="Stun Grenade"/>

A Stun Grenade, also known as a flash grenade or flashbang, is a grenade with several chemical and metallurgic properties that result in a loud pop and blinding flash of light when detonated. This grenade is meant to cause temporary, not permanent damage, and is great for non-mortal wounding, though it is often used as a precursor to armed conflict to clear rooms and buildings.

The Stun Grenade will cause strong disorientation to everyone within the blast radius (~5m) in the form of a loud ringing and a strong reduction in framerate. If detonated within a player's cone of vision (based off the FPS camera), the player will be completely blinded by white light for several seconds. (Exact timing stat needed)

*Detonates .7s after first surface contact

## Frag Grenade

<Throwable throwableName="Frag Grenade"/>

Fragmentation Grenade contains an explosive charge to fragment the outer shell dispersing shrapnel in a radial pattern. Frag grenades can be used to inflict damage to enemies behind cover, within buildings or to deal damage to groups of enemies grouped closely together and vehicles. Fragmentation does not penetrate solid cover such as rocks or walls.  

- Damage reduced by vests but does not damage vests
- 20% less damage to prone players

## Molotov Cocktail

<Throwable throwableName="Molotov Cocktail"/>

Molotov Cocktails create an area of fire on the ground around where they impact. Players hit by or passing through this area will be set aflame, doing constant damage over time. Molotov Cocktails can be used offensively, but don't bounce like other throwable weapons. Another potential use of a molotov cocktail is area denial. If you set the staircase on fire, players will not be able to pursue you up to higher floors, and you can use this extra time to set up a kill zone or escape off a balcony. Molotov cocktails can also be used defensively to obscure an enemy's line of sight, similar to a Smoke Grenade.  

- Explodes on impact
- Does Damage to players in vehicles
- Damage in flame radius 12.5 dps
- Ignited players additional 10 dps for 4 seconds
- Multiple Molotovs increase flame radius
- Flame radius spreads farther on wood surfaces

## Smoke Grenade

<Throwable throwableName="Smoke Grenade"/>

Smoke grenades are a throwable device packed with a mixture of potassium chlorate, lactose, and typically a dye for signalling. The chemicals mix with air to create a smoke screen that temporarily removes battlefield awareness.

- Sound stops ten seconds before the smoke cover fully disappears.
- Smoke fadeout begins when sound stops, so player can start being visible from five seconds while inside smoke.
- Smoke Grenades are spawned at a higher rate compared to other throwables.

## C4

<Throwable throwableName="C4"/>

C4 is an interesting and powerful new tool that gives players new ways to strategically flush out timid opponents. With a massive 25 meter effective radius and damage that can penetrate cover, you’ll be wanting to run away when you hear this beeping brick of boom. A quick note about C4, we don’t intend this to be just another throwable. It has a pretty short range, but can be used to cut off enemy entry into a building or new zone, or as mentioned above can force enemies out of their safe positions.

- C4 will start beeping and automatically detonate 16 seconds after being thrown
Detonation cannot be stopped or activated early
- There is a warning LED on the C4 and audible beeping with increasing intensity, clearly audible inside the damage radius
- Sticks to most surfaces, including vehicles
- Does not stick to players
- Lethal horizontal radius is 25m
- Lethal vertical radius of 15m
- Cover does not protect from damage
- Short throw distance
