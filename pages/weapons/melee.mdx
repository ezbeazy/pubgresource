import Melee from '../../components/Melee';

Melee weapons may be used to strike or throw at enemies. They are also useful for breaking windows and doors. There are 4 Types of melee weapon (Crowbar, Machete, Pan, Sickle) and each type has many different skins that can change the entire appearance of the weapon. However, skins do not affect the stats of the base melee weapon type.

- Within 15m, headshots from any thrown melee weapon will knock an enemy player without a helmet.
- When throwing melee items, player velocity affects throw velocity but does not seem to affect range.
